## AWS Security Best Practices with Terraform

Welcome to the AWS Security Best Practices repository! This project is focused on automating the deployment of critical security configurations across your AWS environment using Terraform. The goal is to ensure a robust security posture by implementing and enforcing best practices across various AWS services.

## Overview

1.AWS Security Hub: A comprehensive view of your security state across your AWS accounts, detecting deviations from security best practices.

2.AWS Macie: A data security and privacy service that uses machine learning to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS.

3.AWS CloudTrail: Enables governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account by logging and monitoring account activity.

4.AWS GuardDuty: A threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads.

5.IAM Password Policies: Enforces strong password policies for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to enhance account security.
